# Key Points:

Avoid Storing Sensitive Tokens in Client-Side Cookies:
Using js-cookie or any similar mechanism to store sensitive tokens like JWTs on the client-side can expose tokens to potential security vulnerabilities like XSS attacks. In your scenario, we should avoid this.

# Using Secure HttpOnly Cookies:

To securely manage tokens that the frontend cannot access, we should use HttpOnly cookies. Setting these cookies via your backend will prevent client-side JavaScript from accessing the token.

# Backend-Generated Tokens:

Your backend should generate short-lived tokens and handle the logic to validate these tokens for each request.

# Token Rotation:

Implement token rotation with refresh tokens managed securely by the backend using HttpOnly cookies.
